@W: MT531 :"c:\kevan\a3035\p3035\osr8v3.vhd":1141:2:1141:3|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 1 sequential elements including CPU.alu_cin.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\kevan\a3035\p3035\ram.vhd":114:4:114:14|Found inferred clock main|RCK which controls 327 sequential elements including Process_Memory.RAM_0_0_0_0. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\kevan\a3035\p3035\entities.vhd":65:2:65:3|Found inferred clock ring_oscillator|RIN which controls 5 sequential elements including Fast_CK.count[3:0].
